## Main script check:
- bash -c 'shopt -s globstar; shellcheck -e SC1090 -e SC2034 -e SC2154 -e SC2086 -e SC2116 -e SC2039 -e SC2028 -e SC2162 piranha'  

## Function script check:
- bash -c 'shopt -s globstar; shellcheck -e SC1090 -e SC2034 -e SC2154 -e SC2086 -e SC2116 -e SC2039 -e SC2028 -e SC2162 **/calcAlignmentPIS'  

## INFO:
- bash -c 'echo "NOTES
Several reasons to exclude shecllcheck errors here: 1) code has been tested manually and works; 
2) checking by eye reveals some of these errors not generally useful (e.g. 'SC2039: In POSIX sh, [[ ]] 
is undefined.' -- but code is written for sh/bash, and here I follow bashstyle recommendations, which 
are considered to reflect best practices, thus supersedes shellcheck); 3) checking by eye reveals that
a number of 'SC2028' comments/errors refer to R script and thus reflect that code uses UNIX shell
commands and creates an Rscript with R commands, creating mismatch between Travis CI lanaguage setting 
and the code (two languages in script).
