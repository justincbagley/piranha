##--THIS SCRIPT automates conducting multiple runs of BEAST1 or BEAST2 (Drummond et al.
##--2012; Bouckaert et al. 2014) XML input files on a remote supercomputing cluster that
##--uses SLURM resource management with PBS wrappers, or a PBS resource management system.
#
##--The code starts from a single working directory on the user's local machine, which
##--contains one or multiple XML input files with extension '*run.xml' (where * is any
##--set of alphanumeric characters separated possibly by underscores but no spaces). These 
##--files are identified and run through the BEASTRunner pipeline, which involves four
##--steps, as follows: 1) copy each XML file four times to create 5 separate run XML
##--files; 2) make directories for runs (1 per XML) and create a shell script with the name 
##--"beast_pbs.sh" that is specific to the input and can be used to submit job to 
##--supercomputer and move this PBS shell script into the corresponding folder; 3) create 
##--a batch submission file (PBS format) and move it and all run folders to the desired
##--working directory on the supercomputer; 4) execute the batch submission file on the
##--supercomputer so that all jobs are submitted to the supercomputer queue.
#
##--Like other software programs such as BPP, G-PhoCS, and GARLI, some information that is
##--used by BEASTRunner.sh is fed to the program by culling the data from an external
##--configuration file, named "beast_runner.cfg". There are six entries that users
##--can supply in this file. However, three of these are essential for running BEAST
##--using the BEASTRunner script, including: ssh user account info, the path to the parent 
##--directory for BEAST runs on the supercomputer, and the user's email address. Users
##--must fill this information in and save a new version of the .cfg file in the 
##--working directory on their local machine prior to calling the program. Only then
##--can the user call the program by opening a terminal window, typing "./BEASTRunner.sh",
##--and pressing return.
#
##--It is assumed that BEAST1 (e.g. v1.8.3) or BEAST2 (e.g. 2.4++) is installed on the
##--supercomputer, and that the user can provide absolute paths to the software in the 
##--configuration file. During generation of the BEAST submission scripts (STEP #2 above), 
##--there are options within the shell script template area of the BEASTRunner code (on
##--Lines 268-288) that could (and probably should) be edited by the user, but which provide 
##--an illustration of how to load prerequisite Java and Beagle library modules on a 
##--supercomputing cluster that uses modules. However, especially when many different 
##--versions are available, or modules are unavailable on your supercomputer, it will be
##--more convenient to supply the whole path to BEAST executables instead of using module
##--code like this. 
#
##--POTENTIAL ERRORS / ISSUES TO AVOID:
##--Users will need to be especially mindful of the following potential issues, to avoid
##--them and keep BEASTRunner from failing on the first go-throughs:
##--1. Like most other scripts within PIrANHA, BEASTRunner assumes that the user has set
##--   up passwordless ssh acces. See notes within the script, and in the PIrANHA README
##--   file for links and information on how to set this up **PRIOR TO RUNNING**.
##--
##--2. The supercomputer that BEASTRunner was initially developed to work on uses modules
##--   to load different versions of BEAST and java/java runtime environment on which
##--   BEAST software depends. Make sure to modify the module calls in the script to match 
##--   your cluster and needs, or remove them as needed. 
##--       - If you run BEASTRunner on the BYU FSL supercomputer, it will almost run out 
##--         of the box. You will only need to point the BEAST paths to your local installs
##--         or edit the module code slightly.
##--       - Users of other supercomputing clusters will likely need to make more substantial
##--         changes to the code before running.
##--3. I urge everyone who uses the software to remove my email address from the notification
##--   section / M flag at Line 92 of the script. DO NOT submit jobs with notifications
##--   pointed to my personal email. If you do this, I will simply delete all of your 
##--   notifications.
##--  
##--4. If your supercomputing cluster does not have a PBS wrapper, then the shell scripts
##--   generated by BEASTRunner to submit each unique job/XML file will not be correctly
##--   read and interpreted by your batch management software. In this case, you will
##--   most likely need to modify the text echoed to file on Lines 87-129 to take the 
##--   format of a SLURM sbatch script. In future versions of BEASTRunner, I will extend
##--   the code to accomodate both TORQUE/PBS resource management and SLURM Workload
##--   Manager, so that you can simply direct the script to use one or the other.
