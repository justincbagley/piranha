 ${bold}OVERVIEW${reset}
 THIS SCRIPT automates conducting multiple runs of BEAST1 or BEAST2 (Drummond et al. 2012;
 Bouckaert et al. 2014) XML input files on a remote supercomputing cluster that uses SLURM
 resource management with PBS wrappers, or a PBS resource management system.
	The code starts from a single working directory on the user's local machine, which 
 contains one or multiple XML input files with extension '*run.xml' (where * is any set of 
 alphanumeric characters separated possibly by underscores but no spaces). These files are 
 identified and run through the BEASTRunner pipeline, which involves five steps, as follows: 
 1) set up the workspace; 2) copy each XML file n times to create n+1 separate XML run files; 
 3) make directories for 1 run per XML (nRuns) and create a shell script with the name 
 'beast_pbs.sh' that is specific to the input and can be used to submit job to supercomputer 
 and move this PBS shell script into the corresponding folder; 4) create a PBS-format batch 
 submission file and move it and all run folders to the desired working directory on the 
 supercomputer; 5) execute the batch submission file on the supercomputer so that all jobs 
 are submitted to the supercomputer queue.
	Like other software programs such as BPP, G-PhoCS, and GARLI, some information that is 
 used by BEASTRunner is fed to the program from an external configuration file, which is 
 named 'beast_runner.cfg'. There are six entries that users can supply in this file. However, 
 three of these are essential for running BEAST using the BEASTRunner script, including: 
 ssh user account info, the path to the parent directory for BEAST runs on the supercomputer, 
 and the user's email address. Users must fill this information in and save a new version of 
 the .cfg file in the working directory on their local machine prior to calling the program. 
 Only then can the user call the program by typing './BEASTRunner.sh' and pressing return.
	It is assumed that BEAST1 (e.g. v1.8.3++) or BEAST2 (e.g. 2.4++) is installed on the
 supercomputer, and that the user can provide absolute paths to the BEAST jar file in the 
 cfg file. Last testing was conducted using BEAST v2.4.5. Check for BEAST2 updates at 
 <http://BEAST2.org>. 

 ${bold}Usage examples:${reset}
 Call the program using PIrANHA, as follows:
    piranha -f BEASTRunner                                Run with default settings
    piranha -f BEASTRunner -n 10                          Change the number of runs to 10
    piranha -f BEASTRunner -n 10 -w 24:00:00              Also edit run walltime
    piranha -f BEASTRunner -n 10 -w 24:00:00 -m 2048M     Change memory (RAM) allocation to 2GB

 the .cfg file in the working directory on their local machine prior to calling the program. 
 Only then can the user call the program by typing './BEASTRunner.sh' and pressing return.
	It is assumed that BEAST1 (e.g. v1.8.3++) or BEAST2 (e.g. 2.4++) is installed on the
 supercomputer, and that the user can provide absolute paths to the BEAST jar file in the 
 cfg file. Last testing was conducted using BEAST v2.4.5. Check for BEAST2 updates at 
 <http://BEAST2.org>. 

 ${bold}DETAILS${reset}
 The -n flag sets the number of independent BEAST runs to be submitted to the supercomputer
 for each model specified in a .xml file in the current working directory. The default is 5
 runs.

 The -w flag passes the expected amount of time for each BEAST run to the supercomputer
 management software, in hours:minutes:seconds (00:00:00) format. If your supercomputer does 
 not use this format, or does not have a walltime requirement, then you will need to modify 
 the shell scripts for each run and re-run them without specifying a walltime.

 The -m flag passes the amount of RAM memory to be allocated to beast.jar/Java during each
 BEAST run. The default (5120 megabytes, or ~5 gigabytes) is around five times the typical
 default value of 1024M (~1 GB). Suggested values in MB units: 1024M, 2048M, 3072M, 4096M, 
 or 5120M, or in terms of GB units: 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G.
 
 ${bold}Usage examples:${reset}
 Call the program using PIrANHA, as follows:
    piranha -f BEASTRunner                                Run with default settings
    piranha -f BEASTRunner -n 10                          Change the number of runs to 10
    piranha -f BEASTRunner -n 10 -w 24:00:00              Also edit run walltime
    piranha -f BEASTRunner -n 10 -w 24:00:00 -m 2048M     Change memory (RAM) allocation to 2GB
